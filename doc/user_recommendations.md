# User Recommendations & Best Practices for Tejas

Welcome to Tejas! To get the most out of your automated job application tracker, please keep the following recommendations in mind.

## 1. Use a Dedicated Email Address 📧

We highly recommend using a **dedicated email address** (e.g., `yourname.jobs@gmail.com`) specifically for your job applications.

- **Why?** This significantly reduces "false positives" (non-job related emails being incorrectly flagged) and keeps your personal inbox clutter-free.
- **Bonus:** It makes it easier for you to mentally separate job hunting from your daily life.

## 2. Mistaken Categorization? Help Us Fix It ✍️

Our parsing engine is smart, but it's still learning. You might occasionally find an email or application sent to the wrong category.

- **What to do:** If you see a mistake, please manually correct it using the dashboard tools (e.g., "Mark as Not Job Related" or change the status).
- **Be Kind:** Correcting these helps the system learn and improve for everyone.

## 3. Privacy & Permissions (Read-Only) 🔒

Tejas is designed to be a passive tracker.

- **Read-Only:** We only **read** your emails to extract application data.
- **No Writing:** Tejas **cannot** and **will not** send emails on your behalf, nor can it delete anything from your inbox.

## 4. A Note on Expectations 🛠️

Tejas is a **small, passion project** built to help fellow job seekers.

- **Alpha Stage:** Please set your expectations accordingly. You may encounter occasional bugs or quirks.
- **Feedback:** If you run into issues, please report them kindly! I am actively working to fix bugs and improve the experience based on your feedback.

Happy Job Hunting! 🚀
